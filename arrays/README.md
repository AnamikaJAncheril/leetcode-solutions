# Arrays

This folder contains array-based LeetCode problems solved using Python.

I focus on:
- understanding the problem clearly
- writing simple intuition
- step-by-step approach
- clean and beginner-friendly code
- time and space complexity

Problems here help build strong basics in arrays and prefix sum concepts.
